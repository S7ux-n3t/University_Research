In the given lab brife Mark recommended to use two online tool in the following section 
"This lab will use the tools on the http://www.cryptool-online.org/ or the https://www.dcode.fr 
website to give you the opportunity to learn about ciphers and to test them in an interactive way within your browser,
from taking part in the ctf I have found that these online tools thend not to give the best results, so I have decided
to use a tool that i know called cyber chef which can be found https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ developed by GCHQ for 
learning, encrypting and decrypting given ciphers.

Exercise 1: Rotational ciphers (substitution or shift Ciphers)
  Decode this classic Caesar’s ciphers:
    a. Wkh ruljlqdo Fdhvdu flskhu dozdBv xvhg d vkliw ri wkuhh
    
    As this is an unknown rotation of the Ceaser Cipher I defeault back to the default tool of https://www.dcode.fr that
    allows the user to check all possible shifts of the ceaser cipher. using this the top return for the given cipher is
    THEORIGINALCAESARCIPHERALWAYSUSEDASHIFTOFTHREE =	THE ORIGINAL CAESAR CIPHER ALWAYS USED A SHIFT OF THREE 
    Wkh ruljlqdo Fdhvdu flskhu dozdBv xvhg d vkliw ri wkuhh = THE ORIGINAL CAESAR CIPHER ALWAYS USED A SHIFT OF THREE
    This cipher used a shift of +3


  Decode this ROT-13 cipher:
    b. EBG 13 JNF HFRQ OL ZVPEBFBSG SBE RAPBQVAT JVAQBJF ERTVFGEL RAGEVRF
    
    for decodeding ROT-13 I will use cyberchef by GCHQ for this, by dragging the ROT-13 moudle from the selection pannel
    and giving the cipher it has printed out the following data from the given cipher
    ROT 13 WAS USED BY MICROSOFT FOR ENCODING WINDOWS REGISTRY ENTRIES
    
    EBG 13 JNF HFRQ OL ZVPEBFBSG SBE RAPBQVAT JVAQBJF ERTVFGEL RAGEVRF =  ROT 13 WAS USED BY MICROSOFT FOR ENCODING WINDOWS REGISTRY ENTRIES
    
    
  Try decode the following messages that have all been encoded using shift ciphers.
    c. MYWWYX FKBSKDSYXC YP DRO CRSPD KBO YPDOX ECON VSUO NSPPOBOXD UOIC
    testing this guy against the ceaser cipher with trying ever form of ship possible I found that it was indeed a ceaser chiper
    with a shift of +10 COMMONVARIATIONSOFTHESHIFTAREOFTENUSEDLIKEDIFFERENTKEYS 
    MYWWYX FKBSKDSYXC YP DRO CRSPD KBO YPDOX ECON VSUO NSPPOBOXD UOIC = COMMON VARIATIONS OF THE SHIFT ARE OF TEN USED LIKE DIFFERENT KEYS
    
  
    d. RFCQC AGNFCPQ YPC RPGTGYJ RM APYAI YLB QMJTC CTCL ZW FYLB
    this cipher showed up both as a ceaser cipher of +24 shifts as THESE CIPHERS ARE TRIVIAL TO CRACK AND SOLVE EVEN BY HAND
    but this also showed up in cyberchef as ROT-13 with a rotation of 54 giving the exsact same output 
    RFCQC AGNFCPQ YPC RPGTGYJ RM APYAI YLB QMJTC CTCL ZW FYLB = THESE CIPHERS ARE TRIVIAL TO CRACK AND SOLVE EVEN BY HAND
    
    e. (:E9 6IA6C:6?46 J@F H:== DE2CE E@ C64@8?:D6 E96 492C24E6C D6ED @7 6249 6?4@5:?8]
    Checking this cipher in CyberChef with the ROT-47 module it decrypts the key 
    (:E9 6IA6C:6?46 J@F H:== DE2CE E@ C64@8?:D6 E96 492C24E6C D6ED @7 6249 6?4@5:?8] = With experience you will start to recognise the character sets of each encoding.
    


Exercise 2: Substitution Ciphers

  Try decoding some of these ciphertexts.
    a. Atbash: zgyzhs xrksvi dzh z hfyhgrgfgrlm xrksvi gszg ivevihvw gsv zokszyvg
    using the atbash decrypter in cyberchef it dumps out the correct cipher straight away as 
    zgyzhs xrksvi dzh z hfyhgrgfgrlm xrksvi gszg ivevihvw gsv zokszyvg = atbash cipher was a substitution cipher that reversed the alphabet

    b. Kamasultra: Irtg tg kf qwkjbvq
    Upper half: KBJHOESNWYCVI
    Lower half: APMRZQGFXDULT
    I was unable to to do this cipher using cyberchef as the subsititute cipher would not recongised the upper and lower cipher keys
    So I did this by hand recongising that the letter in the cipher corisponded with the oposite letter on the cipher key which decrypted
    to Irtg tg kf qwkjbvq = This is an example
    
    c. reqdhqxol mxmclfuf uf gtq bql gy neqmbuxs fhnfgughguyx ouztqef gtq cyxsqe gtq wqffmsq gtq qmfuqe ug nqoywqf
    from doing CTF i use a tool to solve complex time consumming challenges hosted on quipqiup.com that decrypted the output to the
    following 
    frequency analysis is the key to breaking substitution ciphers the longer the message the easier it becomes


Exercise 3:
Try decode this Vigenère cipher:
  mS jeNSkSfUkSaN TSbHVbe BVMMMV ZaPlVMR, gOaPcO NEXKZ TiiUNX da
  AkdMCb KZD UOOOUO fHVW, MNU dTE nOMKeOeSVc MSjYOIRdQD nSfH kRQM

  FUGVXèdE TSbHVb NUk dTEiO MRV WMNp YfHVbe WZdT VVbk SZWULRb
  PEjSSNj.
  
  Since the key is unknown for this Vigenere Cipher I decided to use an online tool hosted at www.guballa.de
  for bruteforcing the cipher, after a few seconds the tool found that the key used was mark and returned the output
  of the given ciper to be.
