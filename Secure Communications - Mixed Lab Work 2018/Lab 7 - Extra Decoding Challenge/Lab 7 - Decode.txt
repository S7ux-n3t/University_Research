Encoded message 1: V2VsbCBkb25lIHlvdSBzb2x2ZWQgcGFydCAx
Cryptic Hint: Think base
code was base64 and decoded to = Well done you solved part 1


Encoded message 2: d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4
Cryptic Hint: This is a popular #
code was in MD5 and decrypted to qwerty

Cryptic Hint: unlucky for some
This code was an anogram common on microsoft and was decoded to Can you believe Microsoft used this to encode its registry values!


Encoded message 4:
(6== 5@?6[ E9:D :D 2 >F49 =6DD @7E6? FD65 6?4@5:?8 D496>6
Cryptic Hint: why does it have to be 13?
This code was in ROT47 and decoded to Well done, this is a much less often used encoding scheme

Cryptic Hint: it doesn’t have to be just once!
this was base 64 using a different alphabeth which was N-ZA-Mn-z-m0-9+/=
it decodes as - wow! impressive this was very tricky, well done in solving this, only one more to go, good luck
