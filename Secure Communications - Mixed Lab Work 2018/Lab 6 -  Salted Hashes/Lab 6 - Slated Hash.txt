Cracking Salted Hashes
#############################


Reading trough the brife there was multiple hints, the one that seems to be most possible is www.exploringsecurity.com as a form of salt.
using a hash identification tool online - https://www.onlinehashcrack.com/hash-identification.php hash recommedned that the hashes are
Sha1 hashesh and since the brife descibes that it is a ecnryted as salt + hash we know where to put the possible salt when cracking the
Password files. Doing my normal procedure I googled the hashes, to which I found multiple form posts by past students trying to figure
out how to crack them. Was no help

so on my personel built cracking rig I personaly own at home, I threw the hashes into text file called hashes.txt in following input

and throwing the command into Hashcat on my Parrot OS currently Virtualised on my Proxmox server

hashcat -m 120 -a 3 hashs.txt --force

the -m stands for mode, 120 is the mode for salted sha1 hashes, -a is the atttack mode, 3 is the mode bruteforce, hashs.txt is where 
the hashes and salt is located and --force means to force cracking and bypass errors as I havenot configured the proper drivers
for my bridged network cards yet.

The whole proces on my server took 10 minutes in tottal

The last pass was the hardest to crack but given some researcha and talking with fellow
students I decided to change the format fo the command and instead use this command
hashcat -m 120 -a 3 -1 ?l?u?d hash.txt ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1
